Template for Löve2D,  to speed up game development  

You'll want to draw your own icon, most likely.  Included to show conf.lua syntax.  

Includes a bunch'a **3-letter abbreviations.**  See inside for details.  

You could type out *love.graphics* or *love.audio* everytime,  
or just type out the *first 3 letters of the module* you wish to use.  

In this case, it would simply be 'gra' or 'aud'  

---  
To use this, you'll need Löve2d  
https://love2d.org  

Linux: *enter dir, then type*  
`love .`  

Win, Mac:  *drag folder on Love shortcut*  

for more info, see https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started

I realize there's no player in there yet.  
Was going to put a guy at the bottom that runs around,  
using a gun you aim with the mouse...  

Then I thought of a breakout clone,  
where you control a paddle-and-ball that destroy the words.  

But that would take individual clone / placement of letteres,  
and collision detection - which is do-able, just takes time.

The spacing is so I can explain it to my kid.  

'space space equals' accentuates the difference between = and ==  
You'll see inside the code.  It's not that hard to figure out. 

Lua doesn't mind spacing, so you can do a  
find 'space dot' and replace with 'dot' easily enough,  
or 'space space equals' with 'equals' if you prefer.  

The idea is to make Lua games easy.  
If my kid can get it, you can too.

**YouTube clips to help speed up the learning process.**

I hate "Learn X programming language in an Hour" vids,  
'cuz they skim over everything to cram it all in.  

That said, this one is decent.

Here is a decent playlist that breaks down the steps involved.

This one is annoying for the reason I gave above.

The cheat-sheet is easier than listening to him rattle on.

I've watched a ton of Lua vids, and that might be the best way,
'cuz you'll get something from one, and something else from another.
