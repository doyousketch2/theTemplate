# theTemplate
Template for Löve2D,  to speed up game development  

You'll want to draw your own icon, most likely.  Included to show conf.lua syntax.  

Includes a bunch'a **3-letter abbreviations.**  See inside for details.  

You could type out *love.graphics* or *love.audio* everytime,  
or just type out the *first 3 letters of the module* you wish to use.  

In this case, it would simply be 'gra' or 'aud'

To use this, you'll need Löve2d  
https://love2d.org  

Linux: *enter dir, then type*  
`love .`  

Win, Mac:  *drag folder on Love shortcut*

I realize there's no player in there yet.  
Was going to put a guy at the bottom that runs around, 
using a gun you aim with the mouse...

Then I thought of a breakout clone,  
where you control a paddle-and-ball that destroy the words.  

But that would take individual clone / placement of letteres,  
and collision detection - which is do-able, just takes time.
