# theTemplate
Template for Love2D,  to speed up game development  

You'll want to draw your own icon, most likely.  
It's there to show conf.lua syntax.  

Includes a bunch'a **3-letter abbreviations.**  

You can type out "love.graphics" or "love.audio" everytime,  
or just type out the first 3 letters of the module you wish to use.  

In this case, it would simply be 'gra' or 'aud'
